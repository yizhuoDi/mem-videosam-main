The current version of the code has saved the box and object tokens data obtained from the DINO-SAM process in order to speed up the training process. 
The saved data is then directly extracted for training, resulting in faster training speeds.

videosam.py
The implemented version of the code runs on a single GPU and can be launched using the train.sh script.
No issues have been identified at this time.

videosam_test.py
Attempted to implement code to run on 4 GPUs using DistributedDataParallel, but encountered frequent errors during runtime.
The root cause of the errors has not been identified yet, and further investigation is necessary
