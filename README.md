# VideoSAM



## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.


### Install without Docker

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install Grounding DINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
```


Install diffusers:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```

Install osx:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd grounded-sam-osx && bash install.sh
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```
